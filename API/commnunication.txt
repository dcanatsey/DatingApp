I take communication protocols very seriously.  Mostly for efficiency, but also for manners.


In general any communictions with others should be considered privileged and not shared with anyone without other parites consent. Reasonable exceptions can be made 


In Person
Least formal
This is my preferred method.  We will be able to use all of our senses to derive context and meaning.  

Zoom
Almost as informal, unless recorded
Almost as good as in person


Email
Email has a wonderful feature called a 'subject' line.  It purpose is to quickly convey context and meaning.  Because you work at Rockstep, you understand this.
Others lacking such understanding email us and we may be compelled to 'forward' such emails to each other.  If the sender's subject line doesnt convey
context or meaning, this is your opportunity to add value.  Change the subject so that the recipient can more quickly ascertain the meaining of the email.

Some people use an email 'thread' as a means of tracking 'chain of custody'  (FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: The think we were talking about.) Stop the madness and 
just change the subject.


Meetings
Most every scheduling application has a great feature that allows you to check availability of peoples calendar.  Use it!
Avoid booking a meeting over someones existing meeting without permission
Avoid booking a meeting over someones lunch without permission
Avoid booking a meeting outside someones regular work hours without permission
